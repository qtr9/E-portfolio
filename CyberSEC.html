			 <p> </p><h3>Initial Post - Institutional Affiliation </h3>
			
			<p> With the continued use of information systems in organizations, it has become critical for them to pay attention to cybersecurity. According to IBM (n.d.), cybersecurity describes the efforts made to protect the sensitive information and crucial systems of organizations from digital attacks. The attacks rely mostly on the Internet that connects people across the world. As a result, cybersecurity has become a global issue affecting all types of businesses from SMEs to large multinational corporations. Firms have found it increasingly important to protect critical systems and sensitive data putting greater emphasis on cybersecurity. The following discussion provides an analysis of the importance for companies to invest in cybersecurity.</p>

			<p> One of the most important reasons companies must invest in cybersecurity is due to the increasing adoption of technology. Modern enterprises use technology for a variety of purposes such as collecting and storing data. Bach, Celjo & Zoroja (2016) demonstrate the critical role technology plays in business intelligence by using the information they gather and store. Enterprises also utilize different devices in this data collection and analysis process. As a result, companies are facing a significant threat from the potential of cybercriminals using these technologies to facilitate attacks. For instance, cybercriminals can use networks and computers to install malicious programs to gather information or conduct surveillance on organizations. In this way, they conduct fraudulent activities such as stealing money from bank accounts or retrieving people’s personal information. Thus, organizations must invest in cybersecurity to prevent these problems from occurring.</p>

			<p> Investment in cybersecurity is vital to boost the trust and confidence of clients or customers. The growth of e-commerce has seen companies shifting to the Internet to sell their products and services (Gray & Zappala, 2012). Companies collect considerable amounts of information related to their customers to facilitate the process of selling goods and services. For instance, they gather names and bank account details to process payments. They also gather addresses to deliver goods to customers. Cybercriminals are constantly seeking such information for different reasons, for instance, fraud. Thus, companies must protect the information to maintain the trust and confidence of customers. Abraham, Chatterjee & Sims (2019) stress the need to protect people's information to secure the reputation of organizations. Therefore, investing in cybersecurity is crucial to protect the information organizations have stored, uphold the trust and confidence of customers, and maintain the reputation of an enterprise.</p>

			<p> Finally, companies must invest in cybersecurity to adhere to regulatory requirements. The growth of the Internet and its use for different purposes has resulted in companies holding significant amounts of information. As a result, governments have developed different laws to secure this information. For example, the HIPAA regulation requires health facilities to implement measures to secure patients' health records (Benitez & Malin, 2010). Hospitals that fail to observe this requirement are subject to lawsuits and the potential of being forced to pay fines. They can avoid such issues by investing in cybersecurity to reduce the potential of cybercriminals accessing systems and devices to gather patients’ data. Thus, organizations must invest in cybersecurity to avoid lawsuits and avoid the possibility of fines.</p>

			<p> Cybersecurity is supposed to help companies to protect their sensitive information and critical systems. Without it, enterprises are at significant risk of becoming the targets of cybercriminals who use the information and systems for fraud. Furthermore, the failure to invest in cybersecurity jeopardizes the reputation of enterprises by reducing the trust and confidence of customers. Investing in cybersecurity is also crucial to enable firms to adhere to laws. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important for companies to invest in cybersecurity. It will help to protect information and systems from the threat of cybercriminals who are increasingly using technology for fraudulent activities.</p>

    <p>Network Security Technologies and their Applicability </p>
	
	<p> Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL VPN) and block chain technologies are essential for network security. Both technologies can help organizations secure their cloud infrastructure now that most businesses adopt cloud migration and related cloud computing solutions. According to Zymr (2021), ineffective firewalls and malware detection, and cryptojacking – using someone’s computer without authorization to mine cryptocurrency – are typical instances of cloud security threats today.</p> 
	
    <p> SSL VPN is an excellent solution to unauthorized access, ensuring that users can only access what they need based on assigned privileges through access control (Frankel et al., 2008; Huang & Frahim, 2008). Unlike the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN, which leverages a dedicated piece of hardware on a specific location, SSL VPN uses a virtual simulation of servers in software, making it a suitable technology solution for cloud-based applications (Palic, 2020). The underlying advantage is SSL VPN’s limitation to web-based applications, preventing attackers from taking over an entire network during a cyber-attack. For instance, when someone launches an attack through customer relationship management (CRM) software, the attack does not spread to other software, limiting an organization-wide security breach. Essentially, the technology is applicable in securing cloud-based software. </p>
	
    <p> Blockchain is a public ledger for transactions, using a decentralized framework to prevent network attacks (Park and Park, 2017; Li et al., 2021). The technology applies a distributed database that grows every time someone linked to the network performs a transaction, preventing arbitrary tampering by operators (Park and Park, 2017). After storing and reading data, the transaction is completed through an authentication process (Sharma, Ahuja, and Goyal, 2018). Blockchain technology addresses major cloud security issues like confidentiality, integrity, authentication. Singh (2021) argued that decentralized administration of devices is one of blockchain’s significant advantages in security systems. For example, decentralizing Domain Name System (DNS) entries can help prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The technology is applicable in storing, reading, and validating data in distributed systems. </p>

			<p> </p><h3>Response: The benefits of a SOC/SIEM in network security</h3>
			
			<p> The article clearly outlines some of the key benefits of deploying SOC/SIEM in network security. By having a dedicated SOC/SIEM in network security system, businesses are able to continuously monitor the traffic flowing across their networks. This way, they have a better visibility of the threats to which their networks could be exposed to. The article however fails to show the differences between SIEM and SOC systems. SIEM is primarily used to collect aggregate log information. SOC on the other hand is a combination of people, processes, and technologies picked from the analysis done on SIEM. The two complement each other with SIEM doing the analysis work and SOC responding to any alerts (Akinrolabu, Agrafiotis, & Erola, 2018). It is also worth noting that SOC/SIEM systems have developed a highly advanced complex analysis method based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This helps to determine the aspects of the data that need further investigation and those that require immediate attention (González-Granadillo, González-Zarzosa, & Diaz, 2021). </p>
			
            <p> I support the views expressed in the article. The application of SOC/SIEM security in business is quite beneficial mainly because it is cost effective, has a better collaboration, and offers continuous monitoring of the networks. SOC/SIEM also reduces the amount of time taken by the traditional systems to identify various threats and act on them (Mohanur Jagadeesan, 2020; Dietz, Vielberth, & Pernul, 2020). Consequently, the extent of the possible damage that could be incurred is also reduced. </p>

			<p> </p><h3>Response: Wireguard VPN and cloud firewalls</h3>
			
			  <p> You centered your discussion on cloud firewalls and wire guard VPN. You highlighted several benefits of wire guard VPN, including minimal attack surface, user-friendliness, high performance, and advanced cryptography. Another advantage you did not mention is that it is easy to detect vulnerabilities in Wire Guard (Lipp et al., 2019).  I agree with these benefits. However, there are some weaknesses of the wire guard VPN. For example, Abdulazeez et al. (2020) argued that the automation of wire guards could make VPN providers log user data. Dowling and Paterson (2018) argued that a network admin could block the wire guard VPN because it works when it is on user datagram protocol (UDP) only. Although these disadvantages can hinder the effectiveness of wire guard VPN, Abdulazeez et al. (2020) argued that it could be better than other VPN protocols, including generic routing encapsulation (GRE) and internet protocol security (IP sec). Therefore, I support your argument regarding the effectiveness of wire guard VPN. </p>

              <p> You also focused on cloud firewalls, emphasizing Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) benefits. However, I think it is important to address some weaknesses of FWaaS. Firewalls have several vulnerabilities. For example, Alsaqour et al. (2021) argued that personal firewalls are vulnerable to hacking due to static IP addresses and open connections. According to Alsaqour et al. (2021), firewalls cannot be used as standalone security measures because of misused security patches, insider attacks, and lack of deep packet inspection. Other vulnerabilities include configuration mistakes and DDoS Attacks (Kumar, 2016). Anwar et al. (2021) argued that the high exposure of firewalls to external attacks renders them ineffective in cloud environments. However, they can be used after taking special security measures. In conclusion, your discussion post is educative and was well-researched. </p>

			<p> </p><h3>Summary Post</h3>



<p> The benefits of a SOC/SIEM in network security </p>


<p> I agree with the review considering how it has explored the benefits of the Security Operation Center (SOC) and the review analysis's Security Incident Event Management (SIEM). First, Liana Havryliuk effectively supports the statement that businesses can monitor the traffic across their networks by having a dedicated SOC/SIEM. Businesses have better visibility of threats to which their key networks could be exposed (González et al., 2021). The response also effectively explains the drawback within the review article and categorically analyzes its general failures. SOC and SIEM complement each other, whereby SIEM guide in doing analysis work, and the SOC helps respond to any alert. In addition, the information on the application of SOC/SIEM security in businesses is effective as reflected from this response is also agreeable showing that it is cost-effective and offers continuous monitoring of networks (Akinrolabu et al., 2018) . It is also true that SOC/SIEM minimizes the amount of time taken by traditional systems to identify various actions and threats. </p>

 

<p> Wire guard VPN and cloud firewalls </p>


<p> I agree with Jonathan Ashmore response to the article review on the wire-guard VPN and cloud firewalls. The information on the importance of VPN supports that it is easy to detect vulnerability in wire-guard (Abdulazeez et al., 2020). The arguments from reviews analyzing the weaknesses of wire guard VPN are reliable because they inform the preference of making the VPN log users' data. I agree with the information. A network admin can also block the wire guard VPN because it works when it is on users' datagram protocol (Shafiyah et al., 2013). I also purport the emphases on Firewall as a service (FWaaS) benefits and the thoughts about its general weaknesses. While I disagree with the information about the vulnerability of Firewalls to hacking, it is vital to consider the secure software Firewall that serves effectively. I agree that there are configuration mistakes and DDoS attacks for the Firewall. In addition, high exposure of Firewall to various threats and attack marks is ineffective for cloud environments. </p>
