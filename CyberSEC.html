					<p> The benefits of a SOC/SIEM in network security </p>

					<p> I agree with the review considering how it has explored the benefits of the Security Operation Center (SOC) and the review analysis's Security Incident Event Management (SIEM). First, Liana Havryliuk effectively supports the statement that businesses can monitor the traffic across their networks by having a dedicated SOC/SIEM. Businesses have better visibility of threats to which their key networks could be exposed (González et al., 2021). The response also effectively explains the drawback within the review article and categorically analyzes its general failures. SOC and SIEM complement each other, whereby SIEM guide in doing analysis work, and the SOC helps respond to any alert. In addition, the information on the application of SOC/SIEM security in businesses is effective as reflected from this response is also agreeable showing that it is cost-effective and offers continuous monitoring of networks (Akinrolabu et al., 2018) . It is also true that SOC/SIEM minimizes the amount of time taken by traditional systems to identify various actions and threats. </p>

					<p> Wire guard VPN and cloud firewalls </p>

					<p> I agree with Jonathan Ashmore response to the article review on the wire-guard VPN and cloud firewalls. The information on the importance of VPN supports that it is easy to detect vulnerability in wire-guard (Abdulazeez et al., 2020). The arguments from reviews analyzing the weaknesses of wire guard VPN are reliable because they inform the preference of making the VPN log users' data. I agree with the information. A network admin can also block the wire guard VPN because it works when it is on users' datagram protocol (Shafiyah et al., 2013). I also purport the emphases on Firewall as a service (FWaaS) benefits and the thoughts about its general weaknesses. While I disagree with the information about the vulnerability of Firewalls to hacking, it is vital to consider the secure software Firewall that serves effectively. I agree that there are configuration mistakes and DDoS attacks for the Firewall. In addition, high exposure of Firewall to various threats and attack marks is ineffective for cloud environments. </p>
